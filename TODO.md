# f311 TODO list

## Top priority

### Documentation

- scripts screenshots (aosss and pyfant as well)

## Low priority

- new script to print filetypes as table

- programs.py: verbose collection of programs; show paths

# Future suggestions

- implement categories in scripts (perhaps a `# cat: whatever` in the source code)

- Enhance programs.py to sort alphabetically, generate single table (with word wrap). BTW it does not list itself
  Who cares which package. But I can filter in or out packages
